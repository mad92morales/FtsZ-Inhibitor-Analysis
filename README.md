# FtsZ Inhibitor Analysis

This project investigates the potential of targeting *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* FtsZ protein as a novel drug target for developing a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent. It includes structural analyses, BLAST alignment, multiple sequence alignments (MSA), and small molecule docking visualizations.

---

## Project Overview

Multidrug-resistant bacterial strains pose a growing threat to global health. FtsZ is a highly conserved bacterial protein essential for cell division, and recent studies have identified it as a promising target for therapeutic intervention.

This project presents:
- PSI-BLAST search results comparing *M. tuberculosis* FtsZ with homologous proteins
- MSA and phylogenetic tree visualizations
- Structural analysis of FtsZ using PyMOL
- Docking studies highlighting promising small molecule inhibitors
